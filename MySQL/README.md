   JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id;
   ```

2. **Find the top 5 most rented movies:**
   ```sql
   SELECT f.title, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
   FROM rental r
   JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
   JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
   GROUP BY f.title
   ORDER BY rental_count DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
